In this talk, we will construct a stratification for the equivariant slice spectral sequence. This stratification is achieved through the localized slice spectral sequences, which compute the geometric fixed points equipped with residual quotient group actions.  As an application, we will utilize this stratification to investigate norms of Real bordism theories and their quotients. These quotients hold significant importance in Hill—Hopkins—Ravenel’s resolution of the Kervaire invariant one problem, as well as in the study of fixed points of Lubin—Tate theories by finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group. For these theories, the stratification exhibits a transchromatic phenomenon: the slice spectral sequence of a higher height theory is stratified into distinct regions, each isomorphic to the slice spectral sequences of the lower height theories. This provides an inductive approach and various structural insights when computing the fixed points of Lubin—Tate theories.
 
This is joint work with Lennart Meier and Mingcong Zeng.

               Calculating the coefficients of equivariant generalized cohomology theories has been a fundamental question for equivariant homotopy theory. In this talk, I will talk about some of my joint work with Po Hu and Igor Kriz in the nonabelian cases. Examples include RO(G)-graded Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology of a point with constant coefficient when G is a dihedral group of order 2p or the quaternion group Q_8, and coefficient ring of &Sigma;<sub>3</sub>-equivariant complex cobordism. If time permits, I will also talk about some possible calculations for compact Lie groups.

                The Gröbner basis is a powerful tool in commutative algebra. We can use it to do many calculations such as computing the presentations of the kernel and cokernel of a map between finitely presented modules over a commutative algebra. However, many important algebras including the Steenrod algebra in algebraic topology are not commutative. We make a noncommutative generalization of the Gröbner basis which can be applied to the Steenrod algebra A. This leads to highly efficient calculations in the category of A-modules including the computation of E2 pages of Adams spectral sequences.

                The classification of manifolds in various categories is a classical problem in topology. It has been widely investigated by applying techniques in geometric topology in the last century. However, the known results tell very few information about the homotopy of manifolds. In the last ten years, there are attempts to study the homotopy properties of manifolds by using techniques in unstable homotopy theory. In this talk, we will discuss the loop decomposition method in this topic and review the known results and our recent work.

The real étale topology on schemes arose out of the study of 
<i>semialgebraic geometry</i> and <i>semialgebraic topology</i>, that is, the 
study of varieties (and their cohomology) in the presence of a notion of 
"inequality". The prime example is, of course, working over the real 
numbers with their usual ordering.
<br/>
Some years ago I showed that a piece of stable motivic homotopy theory 
is closely related to semialgebraic topology: essentially, stable 
semialgebraic (=real étale) homotopy theory arises from motivic homotopy 
theory by inverting a certain map called rho. In this talk I will report 
on an unstable upgrade of this theory. In other words, I will speak 
about the real étale localization and rho-periodization of motivic <i>spaces</i>.

                 Classical Steenrod operations is one of the most fundamental and formidable tools in stable homotopy theory. It led to calculation of homotopy groups of spheres, calculation of cobordism rings, characteristic classes, and many other celebrated applications of homotopy theory to geometry. However, equivariant analogs of Steenrod operations are not known beyond the group of order 2. <br/>
In this talk, I will demonstrate a geometric method that constructs G-equivariant Steenrod operations for any finite group G. This method recovers known C_2-equivariant Steenrod operations and produces new families of equivariant Steenrod operations for all G. Time permitting, we will discuss a few open problems and potential applications to equivariant geometry.<br/>

                Chromatic homotopy theory is a powerful tool to study periodic phenomena in stable homotopy groups of spheres.  Under this framework, the homotopy groups of spheres can be built from the fixed points of Lubin--Tate theories.  The homotopy groups of these fixed points are periodic and computed via homotopy fixed points spectral sequences.  In this talk, we give an upper bound of the complexity of these computations.  In particular, at the prime 2, for any given height, and a finite subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group, we find a number N such that the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence of collapses after page N and admits a horizontal vanishing line of a certain filtration N.

Our proof uses new equivariant techniques developed by Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel in their solution of the Kervaire invariant one problem and has applications to computations. This is joint work with Zhipeng Duan and XiaoLin Danny Shi.

                Synthetic homotopy theory is a general framework for constructing interesting contexts for doing homotopy theory: using the data of a spectral sequence in some category C, one can construct another category which can be viewed as a deformation of C. The motivating example is the fact, due to Gheorghe-Wang-Xu, that (p-complete, cellular) &complexes;-motivic homotopy theory can be described as a deformation of the ordinary stable homotopy category, simply using the data of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. Burklund, Hahn, and Senger used this framework to study &reals;-motivic homotopy theory as a deformation of C_2-equivariant homotopy theory. In joint work with Gabe Angelini-Knoll, Mark Behrens, and Hana Jia Kong, we give (up to completion) a different synthetic description of this deformation, which generalizes to give a deformation of (Borel-complete) G-equivariant homotopy theory for other groups G.
