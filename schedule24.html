Configuration spaces have played an important role in mathematics and its applications. In particular, the question of how their topology changes as the cardinality of the underlying configuration changes has been studied for some fifty years and has attracted renewed attention in the last decade.

While classically additional information is associated "locally" to the points of the configuration, there are interesting examples when this additional information is "non- local". With Martin Palmer we have studied homology stability in some of these cases, including Hurwitz space and moduli spaces of asymptotic monopoles.

            <br />
            <div id="7" class="toshow" style="display:none">
Equivariant Lazard rings over an abelian compact Lie group were proved by Hausmann to coincide with equivariant stable complex cobordism rings, thus confirming Greenlees's conjecture. Hausmann's proof, however, does not give explicit algebraic information on the rings involved. An explicit presentation of the equivariant Lazard rings for abelian groups was obtained by Kriz and Lu in a form which can be considered a deformation of the non-equivariant Lazard ring by introducing Euler classes. However, one is interested in an even more explicit presentation, where the relations connect more directly with structures familiar in formal group law theory. The payoff of such a presentation is that one can then mimic commutative algebra methods in spectral algebra, thus allowing constructions of equivariant complex-oriented spectra based on algebraic properties of their coefficients. One case when such an algebraic presentation of an equivariant Lazard ring was successful was a classical result by Strickland for the case of Z/2, which was used by Hanke and Wiemeler to prove Greenlees's conjecture for Z/2 before Hausmann. Strickland's description can be thought of as a series of blow-ups, which gives a lot of algebraic control. In this talk, I will discuss how to obtain a "blow-up" description of equivariant Lazard rings for primary cyclic groups, with particular focus on a number of subtleties one encounters in the process.

  I will talk about my joint work with Po Hu, Petr Somberg, and Benjamin Riley on self-conjugate cobordism. 
                Using descent based on complex cobordism in the category of spectral modules over $MSC$, 
                we obtain a new spectral sequence whose initial page is the cohomology of a polynomial algebra acting on the complex cobordism ring. 
                The generators are permanent cycles, corresponding to real projective spaces and Landweber manifolds. 
                The action can be completely described using novel concepts in the theory of formal group laws. 
                This situation is a spectral analogue of the classical context of Gugenheim–May's work on the cohomology of homogeneous spaces. 
                By using motivic loop techniques, we prove that similarly to their situation, our spectral sequence collapses with no integral extensions. 
                This gives a completely algebraic description of self-conjugate cobordism groups.

               The synthetic analogue of the bar comonad controls the universal differentials in the bar spectral sequence of algebras over spectral operads. 
                This can be viewed as a deformation of Koszul duality of such algebras. I will explain work with Burklund and Senger on identifying the universal 
                differentials in the bar spectral sequence for spectral Lie algebras over $\mathbb F_p$. This will also shed light on the mod $p$ homology and Lubin–Tate theory of labeled configuration spaces via a theorem of Knudsen.

I will talk about the subject of pre-Tannakian categories, which means locally finite symmetric tensor categories with strong duality linear over a field. 
                Interest in this subject came from mixed motives. Deligne proved that in characteristic 0, pre-Tannakian categories are categories of 
                representations of super-group schemes if and only if they satisfy a moderate growth condition. 
                He also developed a method called interpolation for constructing families of new examples. Especially semisimple examples are 
                highly striking and interesting. I will talk about many examples, including those coming from Harman and Snowden’s recent theory of 
                measures on oligomorphic groups. I will then discuss my own universal approach using a structure called T-algebra, which, under certain conditions, 
                is equivalent to commutative algebras in a certain fixed symmetric tensor category. I will talk about new examples I constructed using these methods, 
                including examples involving the oscillator representation and Howe’s theta-correspondence. I will also discuss a variant of Quillen cohomology which can be used to study deformations of T-algebras.

                For any prime p and integer n > 0 the K(n)-local determinant sphere S(det)
is an explicit K(n)-local spectrum whose Morava E-theory satisfies E∗(S(det)) =
E∗ ⊗<sub>&Zopf;p</sub> &Zopf;<sub>p</sub>(det). Here &Zopf;<sub>p</sub>(det) denotes the Morava module &Zopf;p on which the Morava
stabilizer group acts via the determinant homomorphism. The spectrum S(det) plays
a crucial role in understanding the K(n)-local Brown Comenetz dual In of the sphere.
In fact, by work of Hopkins and Gross the Morava module of the spectrum In for a
prime p is given by the Morava module of S(det) up to a shift. This implies that
there exists a unique K(n)-local spectrum Pn which lies in the exotic Picard K(n)-
local group κ<sub>n,p</sub> such that the homotopy type of In agrees with S(det) ∧ P<sub>n</sub> up to
a shift. In the case of chromatic level 2 the prime 2 is the only one for which P<sub>2</sub>
remained mysterious.
This talk is a report on joint work in progress with Paul Goerss. We focus on the case
n = p = 2. We first show that the homotopy type of the K(1)-localization of S(det)
agrees with that of the K(1)-localization of I<sub>2</sub> up to a shift. This is then used to give
a complete characterization of P<sub>2</sub> within κ<sub>2,2</sub>, which is an explicitly known abelian

                In the nineties, Michael Wiess introduced a Taylor tower corresponding to any functor $E$ from $\mathcal J$, the category of finite dimensional inner product spaces, 
                to the category of pointed topological spaces. The Weiss tower restricted to $V$ in $\mathcal J$, approximates $E(V)$ as an inverse limit. A fundamental feature of Weiss 
                calculus is that the homogeneous layers are determined using cohomology theories. Thus, using this theory one can study ‘unstable problems’ using techniques from stable homotopy theory. 
                In a joint work with Yang Hu, we introduce an equivariant analog of Weiss calculus (for a finite group $G$) in which $\mathcal J$ is the functor from the orbit category that sends $G/H$ to the category of finite $H$-representations, 
                for any subgroup $H$ of $G$. Consequently, we get a Taylor tower indexed by orthogonal $G$-representations in which the homogeneous layers are understood using genuine equivariant cohomology theories. Time permitting, we will discuss potential applications.
