Consider the parameter space \({\mathcal U}_d\) of smooth plane curves of degree \(d\). The universal smooth plane curve of degree \(d\) is a fiber bundle \(\mathcal{E}_d\to\mathcal{U}_d\) with fiber diffeomorphic to a surface \(\Sigma_g\). This bundle gives rise to a monodromy homomorphism \(\rho_d:\pi_1(\mathcal{U}_d)\to\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g)\), where \(\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g):=\pi_0(\mathrm{Diff}^+(\Sigma_g))\) is the mapping class group of \(\Sigma_g\). The kernel of \(\rho_4:\pi_1(\mathcal{U}_4)\to\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_3)\) is isomorphic to \(F_\infty\times\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\), where \(F_\infty\) is a free group of countably infinite rank. The proof uses results from the Weil-Petersson geometry of Teichmüller space together with results from algebraic geometry.

            <div id="3" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                \(\infty\)-category can be roughly regarded as a generalization of the combination of ordinary Category Theory and classical Homotopy Theory. The Kan complex, obtained under a slightly stronger extension condition than \(\infty\)-category, can be processed as (co)fibrant replacement to define derived functors. Such replacement would retain homotopy properties without losing information in higher degrees, making ‘derived-ing’an ideal approximation. By expounding the motivation of the construction of \(\infty\)-category, the approach to construct it, its primary properties and representative applications, we will unwind the heart of Abstract Homotopy Theory including those up to date. As an extending case, it will be sketched why a differential graded category is an \(\infty\)-category. Moreover, we will introduce stable \(\infty\) −category intentionally: it has the almost same axiomatic kernel as Stable Homotopy Theory; its homotopy category has a structure of triangulated category, while its definition is much simpler than the latter; it has a t-structure, forming the basis for its localization to obtain derived \(\infty\)-category and showing us the exquisite evolution during the localization. As to stable \(\infty\)-category, we will take the \(\infty\)-category of spectra as a model example. Finally, we will explain how to transplant these theories to orbifolds with the bridge of stacks which is different from conventional theories of orbifold groupoid, involving how to acquire information of orbifolds in higher degrees from higher orbifolds and how to explore the stability of orbifolds via derived orbifolds.

For an algebraic group \(G\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), we have the classifying space \(BG\) in the sense of Totaro and Voevodsky, which is an object in the unstable motivic homotopy category that plays a similar role in algebraic geometry as the classifying space of a Lie group in topology. 
The motivic cohomology (in particular, the Chow ring) of \(BG\) is closely related, via the cycle map and the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum Conjecture/Theorem, to the singular cohomology of the topological realization of \(BG\), which is the classifying space of the Lie group \(G(\mathbb{C})\). 
In this talk we exploit the above connection between motivic and singular cohomology to show that, at least in the case \(G=PGL_n\), we are able to study the Chow ring of \(BG\) with devices from algebraic topology, such as the Serre spectral sequences and the Steenrod operations.

Elliptic genera of level $N$ for complete intersections
</i></a><br />
            <div id="5" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                
We study the elliptic genera of level $N$ at the cusps of $Γ_1(N)$ for any complete intersection. These genera are described as the summations of generalized binomial coefficients, where each generalized binomial coefficient is related to the dimension and multi-degree of complete intersection. For complete intersection $X_n(\underline{d})$, write $c_1(X_n(\underline{d})) = c_1x$, where $x \in H^2(X_n(\underline{d}); \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ is a generator. We mainly discuss the values of the elliptic genera of level $N$ for $X_n(\underline{d})$ in the case of $c_1 > 0$, $= 0$ or $< 0$. In particular the values about the Todd genus, $\hat{A}$-genus and $A_k$-genus of $X_n(\underline{d})$ can be derived from the elliptic genera of level $N$.

Quasitoric manifolds were first introduced by Davis and Januszkiewicz as a topological generalization of nonsingular projective toric varieties. They can be constructed from underlying simple polytope and corresponding characteristic matrix, yielding the expression of algebraic topology data such as cohomology ring and characteristic classes in a combinatorial way. I will discuss how the underlying polytope and characteristic matrix are restricted by string property. In particular, some necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained in few facets case and low dimensional case.

Dwyer’s tame homotopy theory revisited

Roughly speaking, a space is tame if the torsion parts “disappear” faster than the torsion parts in the sphere. Dwyer showed that the homotopy theory of tame spaces is completely captured by certain dg Lie algebras over the integer, as an analogy to Quillen’s rational homotopy. 
In this talk, I will first give a sketch on the modern approach of Quillen’s rational homotopy theory. Then I will explain how one can study tame homotopy theory using localization techniques from Bousfield and Farjoun. Finally, I will explain how one can obtain a coalgebra model for tame spaces.

Universal Property of the Bousfield--Kuhn Functor
</i></a><br />
            <div id="8" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                
It is well-known due to Quillen that the homotopy theory of simply connected rational spaces is equivalent to that of simply connected differential graded rational Lie algebras. As a next step, one may want to study spaces $p$-locally for a fixed prime $p$. Bousfield constructed the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{S}_{v_n}$ of $v_n$-local spaces as a localisation of the $\infty$-category of $p$-local spaces. The case $n = 0$ recovers Quillen's rational situation mentioned above. Analogously one can localise the stable homotopy category to obtain the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{S}\mathrm{p}_{v_n}$ of $v_n$-local spectra. These are important building blocks in chromatic homotopy theory. The Bousfield--Kuhn functor $\operatorname{\Phi}_n \colon \mathcal{S}_{v_n} \to \mathcal{S}\mathrm{p}_{v_n}$ establishes a connection between the unstable and stable periodic localisations. More precisely, Heuts shows that $\operatorname{\Phi}_n$ exhibits $\mathcal{S}_{v_n}$ as the $\infty$-category of Lie algebras in $\mathcal{S}\mathrm{p}_{v_n}$, and $\operatorname{\Phi}_n$ becomes the forgetful functor. We show that the Bousfield--Kuhn functor exhibits the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{S}\mathrm{p}_{v_n}$ of $v_n$-local spectra as the costabilisation of the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{S}_{v_n}$ of $v_n$-local spaces. This implies the following universal property of the Bousfield--Kuhn functor: every accessible and limit preserving functor $\mathcal{S}_{v_n} \to \mathcal{C}$ factors through $\operatorname{\Phi}_n$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is any stable presentable $\infty$-category. This is joint work with Gijs Heuts.

Computing stable homotopy groups of spheres is a longstanding problem of interest in homotopy theory. After decades of extensive research, plenty of new methods and new results have been established. Yet, there are still lots of mysteries and open questions.  Because these stable homotopy groups are finite abelian at positive degrees, we only need to figure out each $p$-torsion subgroup and work with one prime at a time. In this talk, we will mainly focus on the case when $p$ is odd.

We will review some classical results and computational methods, including the basic setup for algebraic Novikov spectral sequence. Afterward, we will talk about our ongoing work, which computes certain $d_2$-differentials in the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence. Our computation provides a more straightforward alternative to determine all nontrivial Adams $d_2$-differentials in the third line assuming $p > 3$. This is joint work with Xiangjun Wang and Yaxing Wang.

            elementary and much more flexible than previous constructions.  The idea 
            is to feed lens spaces associated to representations of <i>G</i> into Jeff 
            Smith's "machine" for constructing type <i>n</i> complexes:  the examples are 
            thus well chosen stable wedge summands of smash products of lens spaces 
            associated to well chosen <i>G</i>-representations.  The method yields 
            alternatives to the Arone&ndash;Lesh examples and new examples too, and is 
            well suited for investigation by computer.   For example, we are able to 
            resolve the first unknown case, when <i>G</i> is the dihedral group of order 
            8 and <i>H</i> is a noncentral subgroup of order 2: the maximal shift is 
            2, not 1, as was previously thought.

                Suppose <i>G</i> is a finite group, and <i>f</i> is a map from a CW complex <i>F</i> 
                to the fixed point of a <i>G</i>-CW complex <i>Y</i>.  Is it possible to extend 
                <i>F</i> to a finite <i>G</i>-CW complex <i>X</i> satisfying <i>X</i><sup><i>G</i></sup> = <i>F</i>, and extend <i>f</i>
                to a <i>G</i>-map <i>g</i>: <i>X</i> → <i>Y</i>, such that <i>g</i> is a homotopy equivalence 
                after forgetting the <i>G</i>-action? <br />
                
                In case <i>Y</i> is a single point, the problem becomes whether a given 
                finite CW complex <i>F</i> is the fixed point of a <i>G</i>-action on a finite 
                contractible CW complex.  In 1942, P.A. Smith showed that the fixed 
                point of a <i>p</i>-group action on a finite ℤ<sub><i>p</i></sub>-acyclic complex 
                is still ℤ<sub><i>p</i></sub>-acyclic.  In 1971, Lowell Jones proved a 
                converse for semi-free cyclic group action on finite contractible <i>X</i>.  
                In 1975, Robert Oliver proved that, for general action on finite 
                contractible <i>X</i>, if the order of <i>G</i> is not prime power, then the only 
                obstruction is the Euler characteristic of <i>F</i>.  <br />
                
                We extend the classical results of Lowell Jones and Robert Oliver to 
                the general setting.  For semi-free action, we encounter a finiteness 
                type obstruction.  For general action by group of not prime power 
                order, the obstruction is the Euler characteristics over components of 
                <i>Y</i><sup><i>G</i></sup>. We calculate such obstructions for various examples.  <br />

               Representation spheres and universes are prominent in classical 
                equivariant stable homotopy theory, but more recent approaches to 
                the subject emphasize algebraic structure over the representation 
                theory. In this talk, I will discuss how these two perspectives 
                are reflected on the level of <i>N</i><sub>∞</sub> operads. <br />
                
                Roughly speaking, a <i>N</i><sub>∞</sub> operad is a structure that 
                parametrizes homotopy commutative monoids equipped with additional 
                equivariant transfer maps. Since Blumberg and Hill's groundbreaking 
                work, it has been known that the homotopy theory of <i>N</i><sub>∞</sub> 
                operads is essentially algebraic. However, this viewpoint ignores the 
                peculiarities of the natural geometric examples, namely the Steiner and 
                linear isometries operads over incomplete universes. I will describe a 
                few cases where one can characterize such operads in purely algebraic 
                terms, and I will explain why for most groups, there are <i>N</i><sub>∞</sub>
                operads that are not equivalent to any Steiner or linear isometries operad.<br />

            <div id="10" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                A fundamental problem in 4-dimensional topology is the 
                following geography question: which simply connected topological 
                4-manifolds admit a smooth structure?  
                After the celebrated work of Kirby&ndash;Siebenmann, Freedman, and 
                Donaldson, the last uncharted territory of this geography question is 
                the "11/8-Conjecture."  This conjecture, proposed by Matsumoto, 
                states that for any smooth spin 4-manifold, the ratio of its 
                second Betti number and signature is least 11/8. <br />
                
                Furuta proved the "10/8 + 2"-Theorem by studying the existence of 
                certain Pin(2)-equivariant stable maps between 
                representation spheres. In this talk, we will present a complete 
                solution to Furuta's problem by analyzing the 
                Pin(2)-equivariant Mahowald invariants. In particular, 
                we improve Furuta's result into a "10/8 + 4"-Theorem. Furthermore, we 
                show that within the current existing framework, this is the limit.

                The homotopy theory of orbispaces is a generalization of the homotopy 
theory of <i>G</i>-spaces in which the group <i>G</i> is allowed to vary. 
More precisely, orbispaces model the homotopy theory of topological 
Artin stacks (a.k.a. unstable global homotopy theory) 
in much the same way as Kan complexes model the homotopy theory 
of topological spaces. We will show how certain geometrically 
defined cohomology theories, such as topological K-theory and 
elliptic cohomology, extend to orbispaces, and how this extension 
is useful for both theoretical and computational purposes. 
Finally, we will discuss some calculations in equivariant elliptic 
cohomology.

            <div id="14" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                Following the rational homotopy theory of Quillen and Sullivan, one can compute the rational homotopy groups of 
                a space from a commutative algebra model of its cochains by taking (derived) indecomposables. More abstractly, 
                this procedure implements a form of Koszul duality between commutative algebras and Lie algebras. The Lie algebra 
                model of rational homotopy theory generalizes to <i>v</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>-periodic homotopy theory; however, 
                the above procedure generalizes only partially. Work of Behrens&ndash;Rezk shows that the 
                <i>v</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>-periodic homotopy groups of spheres and of certain compact Lie groups can be 
                computed from their cochains valued in Morava E-theory (or some variant thereof), but in general it 
                is unclear for which spaces this works. I will report on ongoing joint work with Brantner, Hahn, and Yuan, 
                which provides a large class of spaces for which "Koszul duality works" also in <i>v</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>-periodic homotopy.
